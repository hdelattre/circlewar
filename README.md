# About
CircleWar is a simple realtime strategy game written in plain javascript with single player or P2P multiplayer using peer.js.

Players take control of nodes (bases) in a connected graph, which produce units that can capture other bases.

Works on browsers for desktop, phones, and Apple Vision Pro!

Use the map editor to make custom levels that you can save and copy to share with friends.

Generate gifs of your victories to share with friends who swear that level was impossible.

Enable camera for multiplayer games to video call with the host and borg swarm them as your face takes over each base.
